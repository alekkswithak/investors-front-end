# Investors Front End

This React application is designed to display a table of investors and provide a detail page for each investor, including filters for investor commitments.

## Setup

Ensure the investors back-end is available on `http://localhost:8000`

In the project root run

```
docker-compose up --build
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
